#### I try to give information in my commits just incase you don't see what you're looking for here...
A collection of Original's toribash mods backed up to GitHub.
Boxfight Hotfixes / Changes / Experiments
    [Boxfight v3a](boxfight_v3a.tbm) *this has game rules me & strangled came to a conclusion on after some playtesting*
### Biggerbash
    [Biggerbash v1](biggerbash_v1.tbm) *the original idea for biggerbash*
    [Biggerbash v2](biggerbash_v2.tbm) *adjusted turnframes & matchframes*
    [Biggerbash v2-1](biggerbash_v2-1.tbm) *adjusted reactiontime, grab mode, and increased dq & dm threshold*
    [Biggerbash v2-2](biggerbash_v2-2.tbm) *added dq timeout, increased dq & dm threshold again, and other changes to bodies*
    [Biggerbash v3](biggerbash_v3.tbm) *lowered dq & dm (?), changed gravity to -35, and other changes to bodies*
    
### Boxfight Bases
    [Boxfight v1](boxfight_v1.tbm) *very cramped, based on the default aikido dojo size*
    [Boxfight v2](boxfight_v2.tbm) *too big for my personal vision of what I wanted, but based on the aikidobigdojo dojo size.*
    [Boxfight v3](boxfight_v3.tbm) *medium sized dojo*
#### all of [boxfight_v3a-e](boxfight_v3-experimental) branch is probably broken, and boxfight_v3b is *very* broken. please play v3a for aikido-esque gameplay. v4b is intended gameplay.

### Boxfight Hotfixes
    [Boxfight v3a](boxfight_v3a.tbm) *this has game rules me & strangled came to a conclusion on after some playtesting*
    [Boxfight v4](boxfight_v4.tbm) *hotfix for v3b -- -9.99 gravity, roof is "relief" zone
